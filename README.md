## Chords-Compiler

Chords-Compiler is a unique and innovative project that translates programming logic into musical chords. By using guitar chords to represent various programming constructs, this compiler allows you to write and understand code through the lens of music. The project supports a range of basic guitar notes and chord families to symbolize different data types, control structures, and operations.

### Key Features
- **Chord-based Keywords:** Use musical chords to represent programming keywords such as `if`, `else`, `while`, and `switch`.
- **Data Types as Chords:** Different data types are mapped to specific chords, making it intuitive for musicians.
- **Musical Output:** Outputs the code in a musical format, making the debugging process more engaging.
- **Example Mappings:** Includes mappings for common programming tasks and an example to demonstrate the concept.

### Example

Here’s a simple example of how a C++ snippet translates into chord notation:

**C++ Code:**
```cpp
int main() {
    bool completed = false;
    int x = 5;
    if (completed == true) {
        cout << "Task completed" << "\n";
    } else {
        x = x + 1;
    }
}
```

**Chord Notation:**
```
(F G):

F# completed = Dm
F x = 5

(C#m | B): completed == D →
(Am | Em | Dm | Em ) ---> "Task Completed"

<— :(A | B)

(C#sus2 | C#m): —>
x = x + 1

←:(A|A)
```
